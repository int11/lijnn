# lijnn
lijnn is deep learning framework project

I referred [chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer) [deep-learning-from-scratch-3](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-3) repository

At the beginning, the project was created to personally research the deep learning framework.
In now, want to many student who study artification intelligent can easily understand low-level deep Learning function through this deep learning framework compare to other complex deep learning framework.
But at the same time, don't want to give up performance.
Ultimately, the project aims at a deep learning framework that takes both the productivity and performance that many people who study DNN use.
